# Snake-game:

## Rules are simple

* use the arrows to move
* *Don't go opposite to your current direction or you're dead*

# Tips:

* you can teleport to the other side by just going into one of the walls
* use ```this.color = {color}``` to keep a custom snake color (use hexadecimal values)

# future updates : 

* Eat food to stay alive , aka starvation 
* better food variations each with its own benefits
* multiplayer?
